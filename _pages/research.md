## Working Papers:
### Pulling the the Plug: Retail Traders and Social Media <br>
 <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3917950">(SSRN)</a>
#### Abstract:
This paper uses days on which social media platform connectivity is exogenously 
	interrupted to study social media’s impact on retail trading. It provides evidence
	consistent with social media platforms spreading fanatical optimism rather than
	rational beliefs. On “outage” days, social media-discussed stocks experience an
	increase in retail trading volume concentrated in selling during the first 2 hours of
	the outage. Social media-discussed stocks experience a price decline that reverses
	over the next day following the outage. These results can be explained by a
	theoretical model of fanatical optimism and are robust to a battery of alternative
	explanations. The paper’s findings highlight the important role of social media on
	retail traders’ belief formation and its stock market consequences.

#### Abstract:
Credit card frauds are one of the most prevalent forms of identity theft. These frauds pose
a unique problem to the banks. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act (1974), banks are generally
liable for fraudulent transactions, not the consumer. Banks want consumers to spend to
generate transaction fees, but also want to minimize their liability to fraud. Research on these
frauds has been limited due to data constraints. Exploiting a quirk of credit card reporting,
we are able to observe these fraudulent cards in credit bureau data. We then document that
banks did restrict credit to individuals exposed to fraud; stopping the increasing trend in
their credit. We then examine the impact of a government initiative to widely roll out chip
cards in the US market. Following increased payment security in the form of the chip-enabled
cards, banks no longer restrict fraud exposed individuals’ credit. Prior fraud exposed cohorts
also experience a jump in their credit limits when chip cards are rolled out. These results are
consistent with payment security lessening fraud risk to banks and document the importance
of payment security in consumer credit markets.
