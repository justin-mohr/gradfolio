## Working Papers:
### Pulling the the Plug: Retail Traders and Social Media <br>

#### Abstract:
<p align="justify">
This paper uses days on which social media platform connectivity is exogenously 
	interrupted to study social media’s impact on retail trading. It provides evidence
	consistent with social media platforms spreading fanatical optimism rather than
	rational beliefs. On “outage” days, social media-discussed stocks experience an
	increase in retail trading volume concentrated in selling during the first 2 hours of
	the outage. Social media-discussed stocks experience a price decline that reverses
	over the next day following the outage. These results can be explained by a
	theoretical model of fanatical optimism and are robust to a battery of alternative
	explanations. The paper’s findings highlight the important role of social media on
	retail traders’ belief formation and its stock market consequences. </p>

#### Abstract:
<p align="justify">
Research on payment security and credit card fraud has been constrained by data
limitations. Exploiting a quirk of credit reporting, we identify credit cards exposed to
fraud in credit bureau data. Using a matched-sample difference-in-differences approach,
we find that lenders restricted credit supply to individuals exposed to fraud, while
consumer demand for credit leveled off post-fraud. We then study the impact of a
sudden U.S. government initiative promoting the adoption of more secure chip-enabled
cards. Following this intervention, lenders ceased restricting credit supply to fraud exposed
consumers. However, despite enhanced payment security, consumers continue
to reduce their credit demand after fraud exposure. Our findings suggest that improved
payment security mitigates fraud risks for lenders, but persistent consumer distrust
about payment security underscores the need for further policy innovations, such as
one-time passcodes for credit card transactions.</p>
