## Working Papers:
 <font size="+1"> Pulling the the Plug: Retail Traders and Social Media:</font> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3917950">(SSRN)</a>
### Abstract:
Using days on which social media platform connectivity is exogenously interrupted, I measure the impact of social media on retail trading activity. On these ”outage” days there is an increase in retail trading volume of social-media discussed stocks. Retail sentiment, while normally positively predicting retail OIB, on outage days negatively predicts retail OIB. This is driven mostly by positive sentiment predicting selling. These outage days are associated with a drop in price which reverses over the next day. To explain the empirical findings, I extend Pedersen (2022) to include disruptions to social networks, showing that these findings are consistent with fanatical and rational beliefs spreading to na ̈ıve investors in a social network. These findings highlight the important role of social media in retail trader’s belief
formation and the market consequences of this importance.

<font size="+1"> House of Stolen Cards: Credit Outcomes after Lost/Stolen Credit Cards </font>
<i>with Divij Kohli</i>
### Abstract:
Credit card frauds are one of the most prevalent forms of identity theft. These frauds pose
a unique problem to the banks. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act (1974), banks are generally
liable for fraudulent transactions, not the consumer. Banks want consumers to spend to
generate transaction fees, but also want to minimize their liability to fraud. Research on these
frauds has been limited due to data constraints. Exploiting a quirk of credit card reporting,
we are able to observe these fraudulent cards in credit bureau data. We then document that
banks did restrict credit to individuals exposed to fraud; stopping the increasing trend in
their credit. We then examine the impact of a government initiative to widely roll out chip
cards in the US market. Following increased payment security in the form of the chip-enabled
cards, banks no longer restrict fraud exposed individuals’ credit. Prior fraud exposed cohorts
also experience a jump in their credit limits when chip cards are rolled out. These results are
consistent with payment security lessening fraud risk to banks and document the importance
of payment security in consumer credit markets.

Often times I find myself waiting on large Stata do files to run. In Python, I like to check the status of my code using a Telegram bot. It allows me to know imediately if a long running script has finsihed or hit an unexpected error. Stata does not easily have this fuctionality. 

I wrote this  program for Stata. It is easily called in your do file. It can send any string message and small files to your Telegram. You will need to make a bot and supply the API token from Telegram
