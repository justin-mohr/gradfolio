			(Job Market Paper)
			\justify{
				This paper uses days on which social media platform connectivity is exogenously
				interrupted to study social media’s impact on retail trading. It provides evidence
				consistent with social media platforms spreading fanatical optimism rather than
				rational beliefs. On “outage” days, social media-discussed stocks experience an
				increase in retail trading volume concentrated in selling during the first 2 hours of
				the outage. Social media-discussed stocks experience a price decline that reverses
				over the next day following the outage. These results can be explained by a
				theoretical model of fanatical optimism and are robust to a battery of alternative
				explanations. The paper’s findings highlight the important role of social media on
				retail traders’ belief formation and its stock market consequences.\\}}
		
		\raggedright{{  {\bf``House of Stolen Cards: Payment Security and Lending Decisions"} \\}
			(with Divij Kohli)
			\justify{
				Credit card frauds are one of the most prevalent forms of identity theft. These frauds pose a unique problem to banks. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act (1974), banks are generally liable for fraudulent transactions, not the consumer. Banks want consumers to spend to generate transaction fees, but also want to minimize their liability to fraud. Research on these frauds has been limited due to data constraints. Exploiting a quirk of credit card reporting, we are able to observe these fraudulent cards in credit bureau data. We then document that banks did restrict credit to individuals exposed to fraud; stopping the increasing trend in their credit. We then examine the impact of a government initiative to widely roll out chip cards in the US market. Following increased payment security in the form of the chip-enabled cards, banks no longer restrict fraud exposed individuals’ credit. Prior fraud exposed cohorts also experience a jump in their credit limits when chip cards are rolled out. These results are consistent with payment security lessening fraud risk to banks and document the importance of payment security in the consumer credit markets}}
